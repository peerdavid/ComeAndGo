## Introduction:

Come & Go is a timemanagementsystem for small and middle sized companies (ca. 100 Users). The idea of this project was, to create a small sample project from scratch, to learn the process, how to create a clean software architecture. The process we used is developed by <a href="http://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/de/competencies/architecture/architekturkonstruktion.html">Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Experimentelles Software Engineering IESE</a>.
<br><br>
The requirements of Come & Go are written by the University of Innsbruck during the SE&PM lecture.
