## Introduction:

Come & Go is a timemanagementsystem for small and middle sized companies (ca. 100 users). The idea of this project was, to create a small software from scratch, to learn the process, how to create a clean software architecture. The process we used is developed by <a href="http://www.iese.fraunhofer.de/de/competencies/architecture/architekturkonstruktion.html">Fraunhofer-Institut f√ºr Experimentelles Software Engineering IESE</a>.
<br><br>
The requirements of Come & Go are written by the University of Innsbruck during the SE&PM lecture.

## Software Architecture
The architecture is available in /architecture/architecture.vpp. To open this file you can install <a href="https://www.visual-paradigm.com/">Visual Paradigm</a> (Free Community Edition).

There you can find the specifications and our scenarios. The scenarios also contains informations of decisions we made and decisions we discarded. You can also find how we increased our level of confidence to ensure, that the design is implementable.
Last but not least we ensured, that the implementation is exactly, what we designed by using our self written cmd tool, which created a class diagram of our code (using google guice GraphvizGrapher).


## Implementation
The web implementation can be found in /web/*.

## Documentation
